    "Biological neuron: The biological neuron is the fundamental building block of the nervous system. It consists of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons, and the axon transmits signals to other neurons. The neuron communicates with other neurons through synapses, where neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals and received by the dendrites of other neurons. The firing of a biological neuron is determined by the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory signals received by the dendrites. The firing of a neuron can also trigger a cascade of activity in other neurons, leading to complex neural activity.\n",

    "ReLU function: The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function is a widely used activation function in neural networks. It is a simple function that outputs the input if it is positive, and 0 if it is negative. The ReLU function is computationally efficient, and its derivative is straightforward to compute, making it suitable for large-scale neural networks. The ReLU function has been shown to perform well in practice, particularly in deep neural networks, where it helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

    "Single-layer feed forward ANN: The single-layer feed forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of neural network that consists of an input layer, a single layer of neurons, and an output layer. Each neuron in the layer receives inputs from the previous layer and produces an output that is fed to the next layer. The network computes a linear combination of the inputs, followed by a non-linear transformation, to produce the output. The single-layer feed forward ANN is a simple and computationally efficient model that can be used for binary classification, regression, or pattern recognition tasks.\n",

    "Gradient descent: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to minimize the cost or loss function of a model. The algorithm works by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters and updating the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. This process is repeated iteratively until the cost function is minimized. Gradient descent is widely used in neural networks, where it is used to update the weights of the neurons during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent networks: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to handle sequential data, such as time series or natural language data. The network architecture includes recurrent connections between neurons, which allows the network to maintain internal state and process sequences of inputs. RNNs have been shown to be effective for a variety of tasks, such as speech recognition, language translation, and sentiment analysis. However, training RNNs can be challenging due to the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradient of the cost function becomes very small as it propagates through time, making it difficult to update the weights of the neurons."
